# Arraynforest

![GitHub Workflow Status][1] ![Codecov][2] ![GitHub Workflow Status][3]

I'd like to preface this with an apology for the horrendous name. Now, with that
out of the way, `arraynforest` is a [gfx-rs/wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/
wgpu)-based library that provides GPU-accelerated linear algebra routines (using
WebGPU).

I'm by no means an expert on WebGPU, or GPUs themselves for that matter, so this
project is mostly a project for me to learn, but if enough people are interested,
and this ends up being more than a piece of garbage, I'm excited to see what we
can do.
