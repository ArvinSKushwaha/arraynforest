I'd like to preface this with an apology for the horrendous name. Now, with that out of the way, `arraynforest` is a
[gfx-rs/wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)-based library that provides GPU-accelerated linear algebra routines (using WebGPU).

I'm by no means an expert on WebGPU, or GPUs themselves for that matter, so this project is mostly a project for me to learn,
but if enough people are interested, and this ends up being more than a piece of garbage, I'm excited to see what we can do.
